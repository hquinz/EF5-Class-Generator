About project

The idea with this project, it's automate the mapper and config classes generator using Entity Framework 5 with Fluent API.

When you have the DB, or when you need to do a migration this can be useful.

Why I create a soft like this, if exist similar projects?
It's true, exist to many similar projects, but all the project only see the DataTables and some of them are closed.
This project read DataTables and Synonyms tables, and it open-source. You can change it, to your custom project.

Yes, maybe you can send me an email to say thanks.


Ok, the functionality is easy, the app, exec some queries to read all DataTables and Synonyms Tables.
Then you select wich one do you need.
The app run, and generate the Mapping and Configuration Class, using the template inside "Template" folder.
